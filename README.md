# BA_Laura: Benchmarking for Fair Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository provides a framework for benchmarking fair ranking algorithms. It is possible to benchmark fair learning to rank algorithms (inprocessing) as well as fair optimization algorithms (post-processing). We implemented four post-processing algorithms alongside three baseline algorithms.
