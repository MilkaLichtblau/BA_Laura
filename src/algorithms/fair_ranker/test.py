class FairnessInRankingsTester():
    """
    implementation of the statistical significance test that decides if a ranking has a fair representation
    and ordering of protected candidates with respect to non-protected ones.

    The test is based on the cumulative distribution function of a binomial distribution, i.e. on a
    Bernoulli process which we believe is fair.
    A ranking is accepted as fair, if it fairly represents protected candidates over all prefixes of
    the ranking.
    To fairly represent the protected group in a prefix the test compares the actual number of protected
    candidates in the given ranking prefix to the number that would be obtained with a probability of
    p by random Bernoulli trials. If these numbers do not differ too much, the fair representation
    condition accepts this prefix. If this holds for every prefix, the entire ranking is accepted
    as fair.
