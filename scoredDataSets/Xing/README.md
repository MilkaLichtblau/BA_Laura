## About The results
* searches have been performed in English without logging in to ensure that the results sorting is not tailored to a specific profile After generating the results, each profile has been parsed in full detail (while logged in).
* The sex of a person was manually derived from the profile name and picture since it is not given on the profile. This helped us filter irrelevant information such as fake profiles or profiles with misleading information (e.g. containing details about a company instead of a person).
* 19 queries returned duplicate entries. In most cases these would show one position apart. In such cases the latter was removed, resulting in a few results to include less than 40 profiles.
Details such as company or institution name were anonymized using SHA-256 to only be able to differenciate between people who worked or studied at the same place or find other patterns.
* `currJob` is always equal to first element in `pastJobs`
* If a profile was found to be employed or studying at the time the data was collected, we replaced the date.
* profiles with incomplete data, in particular with missing dates have been considered as such:
 *//\\* add it to code instead?    * If a job or education entry has no name it counts for an average of 3 months

# Code

The code in `src/` reads the information from all JSON files into a python dataframe that can be used later on. Currently it is simply dumped to disk. To use it, you can execute these commands:
