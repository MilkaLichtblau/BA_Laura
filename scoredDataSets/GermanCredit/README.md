Using these datasets was inspired by the following paper:
Ke Yang and Julia Stoyanovich. "Measuring Fairness in Ranked Outputs." arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.08559 (2016).

We downloaded them from:
https://github.com/DataResponsibly/FairRank/tree/6c1ab4a4751448443c86921976b725530e0cc84f/datasets. 

For our experiments we use only two of the four columns, namely "score" and the protected attribute column
("sex", "age25" and "age35" respectively).
